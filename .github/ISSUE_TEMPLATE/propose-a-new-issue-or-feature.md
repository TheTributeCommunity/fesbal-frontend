# Guidelines
- Try to use the dependencies already in the project. You can add new ones, if itâ€™s needed to implement the feature
- Keep in mind that this is a front end test, it is not required to store the data on a backend
- We are open to suggestions and questions. If you are not sure about something, go ahead and ask it!

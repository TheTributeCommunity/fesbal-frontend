## Styling/CSS
From now on we are using TailwindCSS for styling. There are some situations where SASS can be used but these are exceptions rather than the rule.

## Description  
In the landing page recipients have a burger menu in the top right corner. Once a user clicks on it a menu appears from right to left. In this menu users can find following links:

*  Perfil
*  Notificaciones
*  Historial de recogidas
*  Punto de recogida
*  Hoja de derivación
*  Ayuda
*  Eliminar cuenta
*  Log out

## Definition of Done 
By clicking on the "X" icon in the top right corner the menu disappear from left to right showing the landing page again.

## Guidelines 
* Try to use the dependencies already in the project. You can add new ones, if it’s needed to implement the feature
* Keep in mind that this is a front end test, it is not required to store the data on a backend
* We are open to suggestions and questions. If you are not sure about something, go ahead and ask it!
